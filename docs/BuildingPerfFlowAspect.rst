 Build Instructions

****************
 Python Install
****************

The minimum Python version needed is 3.6. You can get PerfFlowAspect from its
GitHub repository using this command:

.. code:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/flux-framework/PerfFlowAspect

This will create a directory called ``PerfFlowAspect``.

To use PerfFlowAspect, you will need to update your ``PYTHONPATH`` with the path
to the PerfFlowAspect python directory:

.. code:: bash

   $ cd src/python
   $ export PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PYTHONPATH

*********
 C Build

Host Config Files
=================

To handle build options, third-party library paths, and other
environment-specific configurations, PerfFlowAspect relies on CMake's
initial-cache file mechanism.

These initial-cache files are called host-config files in PerfFlowAspect, since
we typically create a file for each platform or specific system if necessary.

Example configuration files can be found in the ``host-configs/`` directory.
Assuming you are in a ``build/`` directory, you can call the host-config file as
follows:

.. code:: bash

   $ cmake -C host-configs/{config_file}.cmake ../

Building PerfFlowAspect
=======================

PerfFlowAspect uses CMake and requires Clang and LLVM development packages as
well as a ``jansson-devel`` package for JSON manipulation. It additionally
requires the dependencies of our annotation parser code: i.e., ``flex`` and
``bison``. Note that ``LLVM_DIR`` must be set to the corresponding LLVM cmake
directory which may differ across different Linux distributions.

.. code:: bash

   $ module load clang/10.0.1-gcc-8.3.1 (on LLNL systems only)
   $ cd PerfFlowAspect/src/c
   $ mkdir build && cd build
   $ cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ ../
   $ make (note: parallel make (make -j) not supported yet)

   $ find . -print | grep lib # successful build produces 3 libraries
   ./build/parser/libperfflow_parser.so
   ./build/runtime/libperfflow_runtime.so
   ./build/weaver/weave/libWeavePass.so
